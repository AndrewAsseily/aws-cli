  "description": "S3 client behavior is updated to always calculate CRC64NVME checksum by default for operations that support it, such as PutObject or UploadPart, or require it, such as DeleteObjects. Checksum behavior can be configured using the ``when_supported`` and ``when_required`` options - in the shared AWS config file using ``request_checksum_calculation`` and as an env variable using ``AWS_REQUEST_CHECKSUM_CALCULATION``. Note: AWS CLI will no longer automatically compute and populate the Content-MD5 header."
